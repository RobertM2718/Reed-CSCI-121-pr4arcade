IMPROVEMENTS MADE:

basic platform (10 points): The game works, okay?

a new kind of antagonist (2 points): Arguably the other players?  Not so sure about this one.  

limited power (2 points): The ship has limited energy for Photons.  

game over/you win (4 points): The ship explodes, and changes color.   

multiplayer (4 points): The game's multiplayer, okay?

artificial intelligence (4): I'm claiming this because of the seeker missiles I implemented.  I think they're pretty smart about how they track down enemies.  

choose your own: 
	(10 points): The game works in real-time over a network.  That's the main point of it.  I think that's worth a decent amount of points.  
	(5 points): You can remap the controls.
